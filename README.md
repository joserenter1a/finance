- Built using Python3

## Anomaly Detection in Time Series
- Types of anomaly detection tasks in time series
- Mean absolute deviation (MAD)
- Isolation Forest
- Local Outlier Factor (LOF)

### What is Anomaly Detection
- Identify rare events that deviate significantly from the majority of the data
- Used in a wide-range of real-life applications from manufacturing to health-care

### Why do anomaly detection?
- Unexpected events can be caused by production faults or system defects
- Outliers can affect the performance of forecasting models

### Types of Anomaly Detection Tasks
- Point wise anomaly detection
    - looking at isolated points in time that are outliers
- Pattern wise anomaly detection
    - looking to identify a sequence of points that form an anomalous pattern
